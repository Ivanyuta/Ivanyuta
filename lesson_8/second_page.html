            My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer. I love to draw and all that is connected with the design. In this area a long time ago and during this time I managed to create several successful projects used by people all over the world.

            I love the simplicity in the design of web sites. As I see it,people, it's like my work. Naturally do not want to rest on our laurels and will continue further studies to improve soybean skills, creating new interesting creative projects.
